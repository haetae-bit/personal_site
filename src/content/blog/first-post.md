i've remade my personal website again, this time with the sole purpose of creating profiles of my rp characters and maybe yap about my interests more.

i think my time on the internet has made me intensely private and introverted, so it's a little hard for me to really put myself out there both irl and digitally. there's just a lot that feels scary about the world, but i'd never be able to make any connections with people if i let my fears hold me back.

this is my attempt to share a part of myself, however small and trivial it may be.
