it's been about two - now almost three - years since i started testosterone. this past week, i went to go get my hormone levels checked, but without getting into a lot of details i hashed out some issues with my doctor and now *hopefully* everything should be sorted out. i just hate miscommunication between my doctor, insurance, and pharmacy. the fact that insurance is essentially a middleman makes it unnecessarily 10x more difficult for me to get meds.

i found it hilarious that the nurse who took my blood sample also played stardew valley and final fantasy xiv, and fps games otherwise. she told me she mained ninja in ffxiv at the moment and didn't like modding in stardew valley. which fair! updating mods and getting them all organized without a good mod manager is a goddamn hassle lmao. 

tips for any trans dudes thinking about transitioning with hormones: note that injections are (usually) cheaper and more effective. you can also increase dosage, but it has to be slowly with your doctor's supervision and advice. you can't increase dosage while on gels, you just take them as is. this next tidbit is more US-oriented, but i've found that my state's medicaid covers gels for free. check your state and insurance to see if they cover them, because they're expensive otherwise.

please feel free to ~~send me an email at xhaetae@proton.me~~ reach out to me on the [32-bit cafe discourse forum](https://discourse.32bit.cafe/u/haetae) if you have any questions. i'm not a doctor, but i've had some experience navigating transitioning and the systems surrounding the process.

(edit: unfortunately [proton is sketchy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42837181), so that email's nuked)
