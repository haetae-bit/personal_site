i'm thinking about starting a nuzlocke run in the gs chronicle hack. i've always had a fond spot for johto ever since soulsilver came out - i remember the pokewalker and suicune encounter vividly. i just wish i was in a place to also get all the event pokemon, but i missed out on a lot of them.

in any case, i think gs chronicle would be a good start because one, it's a hack, two, it's johto, and three, i can (probably) make a little story out of it. apparently in the hack the story is slightly altered from soulsilver's and crystal's original, so that'll be fun to play around with. 

i'm also toying around with the idea of starting a nuzlocke in pokemon platinum, since i've never played that game before and my second and most memorable pokemon game i've ever had was pokemon pearl. hmm, decisions decisions.
